      sub_heading2: "from harm to their health in Childcare Settings"
      main_heading: "Protecting Children and Employees from harm to their health in Childcare Settings"
      paragraph1 : We are the Healthier and Safer Childcare Alliance a unifying and supporting force in the world  of childcare. Our vision is one you most likely share “protecting children and daycare community against harm” <br/> At the Healthier and Safer Childcare Alliance our mission is to assist childcare providers who are committed to  safeguarding children under their care, from avoidable harm and suffering,
      sub_para1: "We seek to carry out this mission — as we:"
      step_1: Help you create awareness about the importance of infection control practices among the childcare community to better mitigate risk infection exposure to children.
      step_2: Facilitate tools and resources that enabling you as a childcare provider to build an ongoing infection risk mitigating infrastructure in your facility.
      step_3: Connect you with childcare providers who are also committed to safeguarding the health and safety of children under their care so that a community of like minded childcares can help each other grow, promote and sustain a network of safe and health-preserving places for children to grow and be nurtured.
      step_4: Help your accredited child care facility become a benchmark by which healthier and safer childcare is measured and recognized.
      president_heading: About the president
      president_subheading: The healthier Safer childcare alliance's president ,Tareq Ghulam, developed a passion for hygiene in childcare from his mother.
      president_para1: In 1961, Richard’s mother emigrated to Norway from Bangladesh with Tareq and his younger brother. In search for a better life, the single mother worked double shifts, but always did a superb job as she worked with pride and purpose.
      president_para2: This commitment was not lost on Tareq, who helped his mother clean daycare.
      president_para3: Later Tareq himself went into providing hygiene services to childcares where he  became confronted by daycare owners who wanted to help fighting spread of infections. Not being able to provide a proficient answer he felt internally embarrassed to the degree that he made a decision to focus on researching the field of infection control in childcare . During this time,Tareq discovered that a lot of the research about child care infection control methods and practices ended up in journals that few people outside of the scientific community read and benefit from. He was also shocked to discover that children in childcare facilities are 2 to 3 times more vulnerable to infectious illnesses than those who cared for at home1 a fact that researchers have documented for decades in multiple settings. And while most infectious illnesses get resolved without disrupting the development of children, some infections can cause lasting physical damage or even death. He was disturbed and saddened by a real life case that made him certain infection risk mitigation was vital to the childcare community. In May 31, 2015, tragedy struck the Learning Vine Child Development Center, a childcare facility in South Carolina, USA.  The Director of the center was notified that one of its toddlers, two-year-old Myles Mayfield, died following complications from an infection of E. coli.  Myles had acquired the disease from an infected childcare worker two weeks earlier.

      question_heading: "Future tragedies need to be avoided"
      question_para1: "The management and operators of this institution failed to follow the best practice related to the infection at hand. In a statement on behalf of the family, Barry Mayfield said: “This lawsuit was never about money. All the money in the world can’t bring back Myles. By filing this lawsuit, we just wanted some accountability, so that no other family would ever have to lose a child the way our family did. We hope that by shining a light on what happened to Myles, future tragedies can be avoided.”"
      question_para2: “While we will forever feel the pain of the loss of Myles, we are dedicated to ensuring that his death was not in vain and that those responsible for operating daycares will follow the rules and will put the safety of children first.”
      question_para3: Today there is little doubt that taking infection control practices lightly cost lives, thus demand attention of all who care for children.
      question_para4: The case of Myles became the driving force behind Tareq’s mission as a father himself, to make sure through the Healthier and Safer Childcare Alliance day care communities are being equipped with knowledge , resources and tools needed mitigate infection risk exposure to children. Those who own or manage and operate a childcare facility take on an enormous responsibility.  For them, there can be no greater tragedy than the death of a student in their care.
      question_para5: No family or daycare provider should ever have to experience the loss of a child under their care.

      promo_header: The Optimum Resource for Childcare Operators Committed to Safeguarding the Health and Well-being of Children Under Thier Care
      promo_text: Childcare environments are a breeding ground for bacterial and viral infections. We owe it to our children to give them the safest and healthiest start to life.
      promo_subhead: Breeding ground for childhood infections with potential long­term damage
      headline: Safeguarding children and day care staff against harm
      main_instro: Childcare environments are a breeding ground for bacterial and viral infections with potential long-term damage. We owe it to our children to give them the safest and healthiest environment possible.
      intro_1: In the world of childcare, the safety of children is of primary importance. As a child care provider you  want to do what’s right for the children under your care and supervision. You want to be sure that all children under your care are in a safe nurturing environment.
      intro_2: Yet, the reality is daycare settings are the breeding ground for infections and diseases. Children in childcare facilities are 2 to 3 times more vulnerable to infectious illnesses than those who cared for at home.
      intro_3: A fact that researchers have documented for decades in multiple settings.
      scientific_fact: "For example:"
      fact_1:  Children attending childcare centres had 51 per cent more episodes of infection, and 134 percent more days of illness, compared to children cared for at home.
      fact_2: A Swedish study reported children in childcare required 40 to 80 per cent more medical consultations
      fact_2_1: for acute infections than did children who are at home.
      fact_3: A Danish study reported 69 per cent higher incidence of hospitalizations among children in daycare for acute respiratory infection compared with children in home care.
      fact_5: For childcare facility providers , understanding why infections disperse more intensively during group childcare, may be logically concluded. Managing a variety of biological discharges, is part of the daily routine. Children, by nature act in ways that facilitate disease dissemination. Little hands can easily become the instruments of illness transmission. Objects are grabbed, put in mouths and then shared with others. Germs of all varieties can easily accompany those objects.
      fact_6: In addition to the obvious physical transferal of bacteria and viruses, there are also the issue of undeveloped immune systems in babies,a factor that could easily contribute to the onset of disease.
      children_risk: Top health risks to children in your childcare
      children_risk_1: The negative health effects of childhood infections can extend beyond the initial acute phase of illness. Some infections have been known to cause health complications during later development in some children.

      children_risk_sub_1: Hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection associated with daycare attendance
      children_risk_sub_2: can lead to obstructive airway diseases and reduced lung function later in life.

      children_risk_2: Otitis media - or middle ear infection - can have adverse consequences in children under 3 years old, including reduced reading comprehension and compromised cognitive ability.
      children_risk_3: Daycare attendance has been cited as increasing the risk of acquiring OME by two to three times .
      children_risk_4: Children who attend daycare also have an increased risk of needing urgent medical attention as a result of rotavirus infection. Rotaviruses are thought to be responsible for between 20% and 60% of hospital admissions in children.
      children_risk_5: Heightened use of  antibiotics and health complications
      children_risk_6: Given that children in daycare acquire infections with greater frequency and severity compared to children at home they also use antibiotics more often.
      children_risk_7: Many studies report association between antibiotic use and childhood asthma, including a large prospective cohort study with more than 5,000 cases of childhood asthma that determined early antibiotic exposure to be one of the most important predictors of childhood asthma.

      staff_parents_risk: Top health risks to worker in your childcare
      staff_infection: Infections
      staff_parents_risk_1: Working in childcare centers involves significant occupational risk for predominantly female childcare workers in childbearing age.  During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes several changes which weaken the immune system. This increases the chances of the harmful effects of infection for both expecting mothers and children. Among occupational risks identified among childcare staff are risk of diseases such as cytomegalovirus,  hepatitis, varicella, influenza, tuberculosis, meningitis, streptococcal infection, diarrheal disease, scabies, pediculosis and herpes infections.
      staff_parents_risk_2: With relation to cytomegalovirus (CMV), small children excreting CMV are a common source of infections of mothers and daycare workers.
      staff_parents_risk_3: A cross-sectional study in 1996 found that 62% of childcare workers --the majority of whom are of childbearing age- had contracted CMV, which carries a high risk of severe consequences for the fetus if contracted during pregnancy.
      staff_parents_risk_4: Furthermore researchers in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that, compared to parents with stay-at-home children, those whose children attend daycare have a highly and statistically significantly increased risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
      staff_parents_risk_5: While it rarely results in disease in normal children or adults, it can be responsible for severe cases in fetuses and immunocompromised individuals. Such as limited to Hearing Loss, Vision Problems and learning problems.
      what_to_do: What to do next—to mitigate risk in your facility, increase safety, and show you care.
      what_to_do_1: Just as researchers have clarified the risk of increased infection rates in childcare facilities, they have also recognized that infection  control measures to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases are both effective and necessary.
      what_to_do_2: The solution begins with understanding that infection risk mitigation in childcare facility require a multifaceted infection control program which goes beyond implementation of good hand washing policy.
