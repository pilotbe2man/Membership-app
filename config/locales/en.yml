      president_heading: About the President
      president_subheading: A passion for childcare health and safety
      president_para1: Tareq er andregenerasjons innvandrer til Norge. I 1961 emigrerte hans mor til Norge fra Bangladesh med Tareq og hans yngre bror. Og han oppdaget raskt verdien av et godt utført arbeid. I sin søken etter et bedre liv, jobbet den enslige moren doble skift. Men hun gjorde alltid en utmerket jobb, fordi hun utførte jobben med stolthet.Og dette engasjementet ble overført til Tareq, som senere begynte å tilby hygienetjenester til barnehager.
      president_para2: “Under utbruddet av svineinfluensa ønsket klientene mine desperat å vite hvordan en kunne beskytte barnehagen mot denne smittsomme sykdommen, forteller Tareq. “Men det var da  at jeg ble virkelig klar over hvor viktig dette med smittevern er jeg innså  at min kunnskap rundt smittevern i barnehager var for lav.  Jeg bestemte seg derfor for å tilegne seg mer kunnskap på dette spesifikke feltet.
      president_para3:
      question_heading: "Store konsekvenser"
      question_para1: Og det var da han oppdaget at mye av forskningen i metoder og prosedyrer for smittevern i barnehager endte opp i medisinske tidsskrifter som få personer utenfor det medisinske samfunnet hadde tilgang til og kunne dra nytte av.
      question_para3: Dette kan få store konsekvenser for utviklingen til barna.
      question_para4: De fleste smittsomme sykdommer forstyrrer ikke et barns utvikling, men så er det noen infeksjoner som kan bidra til helsemessige komplikasjoner hos enkelte barn senere i utviklingen deres.
      question_heading2: One Day, Tareq Noticed A Serious Problem
      question2_para1: Et par år etter at Tareq hadde begynt å interessere seg spesifikt for smittevern i barnehager dukket saken om Myles opp. For i 2015 døde et to år gammelt barn etter en infeksjon i en barnehage. Det ble rettsak av dette, fordi enhver barnehageleder er ansvarlig for at foresatte uoppfordret informeres om forhold som kan ha negativ innvirkning på barnas helse. Det kom noen oppsiktsvekkende fakta fram. Lederen var, for det første, ikke bevisst på omfanget av helserisikoen den smittsomme sykdommen som hadde oppstått i barnehagen.
      question2_para3: Noen oppsiktsvekkende fakta kom frem i rettssaken. Lederen av barnehagen hvor to-åringen omkom var ikke bevisst på omfanget av helserisikoen den oppståtte smittsomme sykdommen utgjorde for barn.
      question2_para4: Personalet i barnehagen hadde heller ikke noe referansemateriale, eller annen lett tilgjengelig informasjon over den smittsomme sykdommen. Hadde de hatt dette kunne de tilegnet seg kunnskap, effektivt gjenkjent farlige situasjoner, og - ikke minst - satt i verk viktige tiltak for å begrense problemet. Som også burde inkludere varsling av foreldrene.
      question_heading3: Drivkraften bak
      question3_para1: Det to år gamle barnehagebarnets dødsfall ble drivkraften bak utarbeidelsen av «tryggere helsebevarende barnomsorg»-programmet.
      question3_para3: Og målet er at spredningen av smittsomme sykdommer i barnehager skal bli så liten som praktisk mulig.
      question3_para4: “Jeg opplevde veldig sterkt at ingen barnehageleder, forelder eller ansatt skal behøve å oppleve tapet av et barn under deres omsorg grunnet mangel på god smittevern i barnehagen.

      headline: Protecting staff and children in your care from harm
      main_instro: "Why care about infection risk control in nursery: A cautionary story "
      intro_1: On 31 May 2015 a tragedy befell a nursery in South Carolina, USA. The nursery manager for the center was informed that one of the youngest in nursery, two-year-old Myles Mayfield, had died as a result of complications arising from an E.coli infection contacted in the childcare.
      intro_2: This incident is a tragic reminder of the lethal risk infectious illness can pose to children attending nurseries and the necessity of taking all precautions necessary to manage the risk. For  a nursery managers there are no words that can properly describe the tragedy of losing a child placed under their care, especially when the tragedy is connected to the fact that nursey the child was attending failed to take appropriate infection risk control measures. In the case of little two year old child who died, parents of children attending the nursery were not informed of infection occurrence in the nursery hence no appropriate protective measures could be initiated.
      intro_3: The tragedy of the situation in this that infection cost the little child his life is not a one-time phenomenon, in fact children attending nursery are shown to be 2 to 3 time more susceptible to infections than children who are for cared for at home, a fact which has been well documented.
      scientific_fact: "For example:"
      fact_1: Studies show that children in nursery settings take 134% more sick days compared with children who were being looked after at home.
      fact_2: A Swedish study reported that children in nursery required between 40 and 80% more medical attention for acute infections than children who were at home.
      fact_2_1: ""
      fact_3: A Danish study reported that children in nursery were hospitalized 69% more due to respiratory infections compared with children who were looked after at home.
      fact_5: For a healthier and safer childcare conscious nursery managers the understanding of why infectious diseases spread more aggressive in the nursery than at home is easy to grasp. In the nursery children play and eat together and find themselves in close proximity to each other while their immune systems are still undergoing development and they lack proper hygiene practices. Everyday nursery managers throughout the country take on an enormous responsibility of looking after children and safeguarding their health and wellbeing,
      fact_6: ""
      children_risk: The health risks to nursery children associated with infectious diseases
      children_risk_1: The negative health effects of childhood infections can extend beyond the initial acute phase of illness. Some infections have been known to cause health complications during later development in some of these children.

      children_risk_sub_1: Hospitalization for lower respiratory tract infection can lead to obstructive airway diseases and reduced lung function later in life. In a Norwegian study conducted NTNU, where one hundred and sixty-one children participated  found that forty-three per cent of children attending the nurseries they studied had at least one virus in their respiratory tract.(ref)
      children_risk_sub_2:

      children_risk_2: Otitis media - or middle ear infection - can have adverse consequences in children under 3 years old, including reduced reading comprehension and compromised cognitive ability.
      children_risk_3: Nursery attendance has been cited as increasing the risk of acquiring OME by two to three times.
      children_risk_4: Children who attend nursery also have an increased risk of needing urgent medical attention as a result of rotavirus infection. Rotaviruses are thought to be responsible for between 20% and 60% of hospital admissions in children.
      children_risk_5:  The risk of increased use of antibiotics and potential associated health complications
      children_risk_6: Given that children in daycare acquire infections with greater frequency and severity compared to children at home they also use antibiotics more often.
      children_risk_7: Many studies report association between antibiotic use and childhood asthma, including a large prospective cohort study with more than 5,000 cases of childhood asthma that determined early antibiotic exposure to be one of the most important predictors of childhood asthma.
      staff_parents_risk: The relationship between infectious diseases and potentially disturbing health risks for nursery staff
      staff_infection:
      staff_parents_risk_1: Working in childcare centers involves significant occupational risk for predominantly female childcare workers in childbearing age.  During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes several changes which weaken the immune system. This increases the chances of the harmful effects of infection for both expecting mothers and children. Among occupational risks identified among childcare staff are risk of diseases such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, varicella, influenza, tuberculosis, meningitis, streptococcal infection, diarrheal disease, scabies, pediculosis and herpes infections.
      staff_parents_risk_2: With relation to cytomegalovirus (CMV), small children excreting CMV are a common source of infections of mothers and daycare workers. A cross-sectional study in 1996 found that 62% of childcare workers --the majority of whom are of childbearing age- had contracted CMV, which carries a high risk of severe consequences for the fetus if contracted during pregnancy. Furthermore researchers in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that, compared to parents with stay-at-home children, those whose children attend daycare have a highly and statistically significantly increased risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Health risks for employees in the nursery can also come in the form of negative stress. When a nursery staff become ill rest of the nursery staff are forced to do more with less. This increase work load and pressure lead to burnout, stress and compromised immune systems which makes them even more susceptible to infections.


      what_to_do: What can you as a healthier and Safer childcare conscious nursery manager do to manage infectious disease risk , increase safety, and show that you care ?
      what_to_do_1: Just as infection control researchers have identified infection risk in the nursery  environment, they have also acknowledged that proactive infection risk control to manage infectious diseases risk in the nursery are both effective and necessary.
      what_to_do_2: The solution starts with understanding that preemptive infection control involves and holistic approach to infection risk mitigation which go beyond more than strict handwashing policy .

      step9:
        title: Ensure good communication
        description: "The third step in an effective infection Control action plan is to ensure good communication with parents and daycare staff. When an infection occurs, especially in the case of hospitalization, other children and their parents may want to know how the child is doing. They might even want to know what you’re doing about the problem. A lack of good communication at this stage may a create a high-emotion, low-trust situation. So to avoid this, you need to have good communication and build trust. This will enable you to quickly address issues that can become problems if not remedied on time. That’s where the Healthier and Safer Childcare Program’s Communication Manager Tool comes in, as it makes it possible for you, as a childcare manager, to:"
        para1: Communicate with parents, and daycare staff from specific departments, where infection has occurred, helping them make sense of the situation.

      phase3_det_subtitle: "Primary infection control  function"
      phase3_det_para2: Managing infection risk exposure prerequisites knowledge in infection control and applying the knowledge strategically, diligently and consistently. The function of the third milestone in the healthier and safer Childcare program is therefore to enable you, the nursery manger ensure that happens in your facility. To enable you to achieve this objective your nursey is given access to infection control task verifier tool and Infection trend identifier tool as part of the program, while infection control task verifier tool to enable you as nursery manager to quickly assess and verify if infection control measures required to ensure infection control safety are being implemented in your facility diligently and consistently. Infection trend identifier tool on the other hand enables you to know when to strategically apply specific infection control measures in your facility as you identify high risk season for specific illnesses throughout the year.  With this critical insight, you are now able to use childhood illness management guide as a reference and initiate a preemptive allied effort in your nursey to minimize infection risk, which not only ensure higher infection control safety but also create a united bond and team spirit between nursery staff and parents’ due to them standing together against expected risk.
      phase4_title: "Congratulations"
      phase4_para1: ""
      phase4_para2: "Upon completion of the three milestones your facility now have in place an infection control infrastructure to proactively manage infection risk exposure to children, nursery staff and the wider nursery community. Hence your nurseries effort to ensure safety and wellbeing is recognized by the association and your nursery becomes an healthier and safer childcare  accredited facility. Your accreditation certificate is sent to you along with an accreditation plaque and your childcare is listed in the portal for accredited facilities for parents to view."
      phase4_para3: " Please note that managing infection risk exposure to children is part of a larger body of work for healthier and safer childcare. The reason for accreditation program being launched with limited scope of accreditation is to ensure that you, as a healthier and safer child care conscious nursery manager can take a step by step approach to adopting procedures and practices that can  make your childcare one of the healthiest and safest nurseries in the country.

This can make them sick , undergo suffering and put their health and, in the worst case scenario, lives at risk."
      instro2: "Let us, therefore, look at why it is so critical, before infection occurs and after infection occurs, to avoid  failing, as a nursery manager, to safeguard children and day care staff against infection exposure."

It impedes their ability to safeguard children under their care from infectious disease risk exposure."
      para3_2_1: "The second critical infection risk area to address after infection occurs is lack of competency in how to control the infection risk associated with the particular infection that has occurred."
      para3_2_2: "This is because the infection control measures required to control the risk of one type of infectious disease may not be the same for another infectious disease.

      para4_2_1: "The third critical infection risk area to address after infection occurs is lack of appropriate action to control the risk of the particular disease that has occurred."
      para4_2_2: "This is because, if appropriate actions need to stop infection from spreading and reoccurring are not taken, no amount of knowledge will help minimize the risk the infection poses to children."

      para5_1: "There is no doubt that Infection control in childcare facilities pose a multifaceted challenge for childcare providers which meay seem cumborsome but falling short in addressing any one of critical infection risk exposure areas consistently and deligently , can expose daycare children to infections that can put their health and even life at risk , as in little 2 year old myles case."
      para5_2: "To that end, in line with Norges landsforening mission to assist childcare providers who are committed to  safeguard children under their care, from avoidable harm and suffering, the Healthier and safer childcare accreditation program has been developed."
      para5_3: "It enables you as healthier and safer counsious childcare  provider to comprehensively address critical areas of  infection risk exposure to children and  daycare staff in their facility hence substantially increase the level of protection of health, safety and wellbeing of children and childcare staff in the childcare facility. "
      para5_4: "While it may not be possible to prevent all infectious disease in child care , but research in the field of infection control has proven beyond doubt nurseries that exercise caution against spread of infection diseases, lower the risk of infectious diseases, making suffering and tragedy associated with infectious diseases less likely."

            content: "An infection outbreak can often lead to confusion, frustration, and even anger on behalf of parties involved. Clear communication is the key to eliminate confusion and frustration.  Communicating efficiently will reduce stress, help in trust building and minimizing the risk of further infection spreading throughout the childcare community. The Messages tool is therefore specially designed to help you reclaim control of communication in an otherwise stressful outbreak scenario. <br/>

      title: How to prevent infection in the nursery
      description: Ensure that the daily lives of children and staff in your nursery is as safe as possible
    content:
      text1: There is no job with a greater risk of infection than in a nursery. Infection control in a nursery poses a real multi-facet challenge for nursery management teams. Failure to address the critical areas of exposure of contagion in the nursery, leading to Infections can leave both children and staff sick, not only putting their health in potential danger but also running the risk of reputational damage to the nursery.
      text2: In line with Norway's National Association for Fresher Kindergartens aim to assist centre supervisors who have dedicated themselves to protecting children in their care from the harm and suffering associated with infectious diseases occurring in nursery, they have also launched the Norwegian Association for Fresher Kindergartens and Accreditation Program, keeping children healthy and safe in nurseries.
      text3: And in conjunction with the launch, you now have a <span class = "pink-text"> free 7 day email course </span> on how to prevent infection in the nursery to help you on your way to a healthier and safe nursery, while offering an insight into the accreditation programme, Healthier and Safer childcare.
      text4: The course is a result of a collaboration between a Private Barnegagesr Association and Norwegian landsfroening for healthier and safe Branehgare

      title: Preventative strategies for action around food in the nursery.
      text1: Primary Design
      text2: Handling of food in your nursery, including storage, preparation and serving of food to children in nursery presents some unique challenges for the nursery. There are countless other opportunities for cross-contamination and damage caused by food-borne illness.
      text3: "In this course, you will learn why:"
      fn1: What IMPORTANT bio-security measures you can take to reduce the risk of food borne illness in your nursery and how to make sure that the infection prevention practices for safe food action are implemented, tracked and measured on a daily basis in your nursery.
      fn2: Which of your staff should know how to identify children with food allergies in the nursery?
      fn3: What mistakes should be avoided when preparing food for infants in the nursery

      label: "Module 2:"
      title: Preventative strategies for the control of infectious diseases in nursery.
      text1: Primary motive
      text2: There are several factors in the nursery that contribute to the outbreak of infectious diseases. A severe outbreak can spread quickly, thanks to the children's habits, the number of people in the nursery and the close proximity they have to each other. In many cases, the way we approach an outbreak of infection and timely bio-security communication between parents and nursery during the early stages of the outbreak can affect the outbreak course and its potential to spread.
      text3: "In this course, you will learn why:"
      fn1: Which essential bio-security measures you as nursery controllers can take before an infectious disease breaks out in your nursery
      fn2: Communication Strategies you should be aware of.
      fn3: What mistakes nursery staff should avoid, to avoid panic when they communicate with parents during infectious disease outbreak in nursery

    module3:
      label: "Module 3:"
      title: Preventative cleaning after episodes involving bodily fluids
      text1: Primary design
      text2: Nurseries must face a daily struggle against bodily fluids, which create a considerable risk of spreading infectious disease-carrying germs and viruses. This is particularly challenging since cross- infection can easily occur when staff  had had direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick child.
      text3: "In this course, you will learn why:"
      fn1: What measures you can take to ensure that there are bio security procedures in your nursery for cleaning after episodes of bodily fluids.
      fn2: Which steps staff should take to prevent equipment becoming infected
      fn3: How to clean the bodily fluids that may contain infectious disease-carrying germs and viruses

    module4:
      label: "Module 4:"
      title: Preventative action when changing nappies in the nursery
      text1: Primary motive
      text2: Changing nappies is considered to be a task with the highest risk of transmission of pathogenic germs and viruses among children and staff in nurseries. The risk of infection associated with changing nappies is quite real as disease-bearing pathogens can spread from person to person; even when there is no sign of illness among the manager and staff.
      text3: "In this course, you will learn why:"
      fn1: The ratio of infectious disease outbreak and performing nappy changing shifts in nursery
      fn2: What measures you can take to raise can take to raise awareness among nursery staff about infection prevention when nappy changing.
      fn3: Overview of nappy changing procedures that minimise the risk of the spread of disease- carrying germs and viruses.

    module5:
      label: "Module 5:"
      title: Preventative hand-washing in the nursery.
      text1: Primary motive
      text2: Good hand washing constitutes the first line of defence against the spread of infectious diseases. A hand that has been in contact with the infection, spreading it onto surfaces that have come in contact with viruses can remain active for a long time. When children and adults touch these surfaces and then touch their face they run the risk of spreading the infection further.
      text3: "In this course, you will learn why:"
      fn1: The ratio of infectious disease outbreak and lack of good hand-washing in nursery
      fn2: What measures you as nursery managers can take to promote good hand-washing in your nursery.
      fn3: Critical rules for bio-security any nursery employee should know about
